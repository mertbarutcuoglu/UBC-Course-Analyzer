# UBC Course Analyzer

- What is UBC Course Analyzer?

As students, when choosing a course or deciding the section of a course, we always try to choose the one that looks like the "easiest" one to get a good grade. Even though easiness of a course is a subjective concept, there are some numerical data that can help us to make that decision, like previous averages, and grade distributions. However, collecting this data is a time-consuming process, and it is likely to do mistakes while collecting the data and comparing it with the data of previous years. The purpose of this application is to automate this process and provide useful insights into a course section that was provided by the user. By using UBC Course Analyzer, a student can find
data about the professor who is teaching a current section of a specific course. The provided data is based on the data of that professorâ€™s previous sections for that course, from the last five years. Currently, users can access the pass rate, grade distribution, and yearly average for the specific course section that they desire.
